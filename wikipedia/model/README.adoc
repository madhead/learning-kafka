= wikipedia/model

This directory contains sources for Wikipedia's recent changes event stream model.
The code could be probably autogenerated from a https://schema.wikimedia.org/repositories/primary/jsonschema/mediawiki/recentchange/latest.json[publicly available schema] via https://github.com/joelittlejohn/jsonschema2pojo[jsonschema2pojo], but instead it is just manually authored here for the simplicity of the build setup.
